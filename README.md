# *Insert Internet Space Name Here*

This repository will be home to everything in my personal collection of everything I do online! 

Other than a home page, *essentially my carrd*, the site includes the following:        

## Imposter Syndrome
Everything to do with my Portal fanfic!
### Basic Content
* Fanfiction itself
* Video & Visual Content
* Dev Documentation or WIPs?
* ARG elements?
* Sounds & Voices
    * AI TTS?
* Voice Acting/Editing?

## The Box
Basically a personal blog!
### Categories
* Writing (that isn't Imposter Syndrome)
* Diary/Journal
* Discussion Board
    * Talking about anything

## Other Projects I'll likely deploy with Neocities at some point...
* [Text Effects](https://github.com/wheatleyinabox/text-effects)
