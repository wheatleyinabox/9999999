# *You've been in suspension for 9999999-*

This repository will be home to everything in my personal collection of everything I do online! 

Other than a home page, *essentially my carrd*, the site includes the following:        

## Imposter Syndrome
Everything to do with my Portal fanfic!
### Basic Content
* Fanfiction itself
* Video & Visual Content
* Dev Documentation or WIPs?
* ARG elements?
* Sounds & Voices
    * AI TTS?
* Voice Acting/Editing?
* Inspiration: [AlmaNet](https://almanet.cc/)

## The Box
Basically a personal blog!
### Categories
* Writing (that isn't Imposter Syndrome)
* Diary/Journal
* Discussion Board
    * Talking about anything

## Other Projects I'll likely deploy with Neocities at some point...
* ### Text Effects
   * Creating a terminal-like site you type in words and it changes the look of the site and or the font of the text you type.
(totally not making a custom site for Imposter Syndrome videos specific text graphics)
   * Inspired by: [justtypestuff.com](https://justtypestuff.com) & [Terry Cavanagh](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh)
